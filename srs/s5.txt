I have an standalone app which is failing to launch on the Apple OSX platform. The App has been compiled using Matlab 2024b for Windows
10, Windows 11, Mac Intel (Sequoia), Mac Silicon (Sequoia). The app works perfectly on both Windows platforms and fails to launch on both
Mac platforms the error report (attached) says that the app launcher is looking for 'libmwsafe_env.dylib' and it does not exist. I have since
recompiled the App on Matlab 2024a and it works perfectly on all platforms. so this seems to be an issue specific to Matlab 2024b for the OSX
platform.
